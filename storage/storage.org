Data
Digital Data = digitally stored, transmitted and retrieved.
INformation = processed data
Information storage management = Effectively store, protect, process, manage and leverage information.
Types of digital data -
- structured = rdbms
- semi-structured = spreadsheet, xml files.
- quasi-structured = clickstream data = which is possible to convert into meaningful structured data.
- non-structured = 90% of the data in the universe (text file, pdfs, images and videos)

Storage devices - types
- magnetic
- optical
- flash-based

Data Center
- Facility
- IT Equipment
- Support infrastructure

Data Center Key Features
- Availability
- Security
- Capacity
- Scalability
- Performance
- Integrity

Data Center Management Process
- Monitoring
- Reporting
- Provisioning
- Planning
- Maintenance

Computing Platforms
- Platform 1 = Mainframe, Terminal PC. Highly expensive
- Platform 2 = Client-server Model. Creation of Silos which leads to hw/sw maintenance overhead
- Platform 3 = Big Data, Cloud, mobile, social

Five essential cloud characteristics
- On-demaind self-service
- Broad network access
- Resource Pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured service

Cloud Service Models
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

Cloud Deployment Model
- Public cloud
- Private cloud
- Community cloud
- Hybrid cloud

Big Data
 - structruce / non-structured
 - needs highly sclabale storage architecture to manage high volume/velocity/variety of data
 - Strong analytics tool for better decision making.


Key characteristics of Big Data
| Characteristics | Meaning                             | Challenges                   |
|-----------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------|
| Volume          | Massive size of data                | Storage and analysis of data |
| Velocity        | Rapidly changing                    | Real-time analysis           |
| Variety         | Diverse data from different sources | Integration and analysis     |
| Variability     | Constant change in meanig of data   | gathering and interpreteion  |
| Veracity        | Varying quality and reliability     | transforming and trusting    |
