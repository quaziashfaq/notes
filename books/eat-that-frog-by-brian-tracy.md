Book Title: Eat That Frog
Author: Brian Tracy


# Preface
You can never finish the tasks. You can become more productive but there are always more tasks to complete in your limited time.

You can't do all the things. So you need to stop somewhere. Then do some things that can bring difference in your life.

The simple and obvious rule is: Find out what other successful people are doing. They were doing things differently. Do the same until you get the same result.

Brian Tracy said, "... I have found a simple truth. The ability to concentrate single-mindedly on your most important task, to do it well and to finish it completely, is the key to great success, achievement, respect, status, and happiness in life. This key insight is the heart and soul of this book."

The key to success is action.
