* Password less ssh login
Let's say my remote host is 192.168.56.21 and my login username is sakib

So in my local machine, generate the public keys'

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Check the following file is created. '.ssh/id_rsa.pub'
$ cd ~
$ cd .ssh/id_rsa.pub


Create .ssh directory in the remote host
$ ssh sakib@192.168.56.21 'mkdir .ssh'

Now copy the content of this file to a file named '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' of the remote host:
$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh sakib@192.168.56.21 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

And change the permission:
$ ssh sakib@192.168.56.21 'chmod 700 .ssh; chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys'
