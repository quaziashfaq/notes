She wrote this book when she was workin in McAfee.
She started the book with an incident having Socia Media of McAfee got hacked.

## Chapter 1: Lessons Learned
1. The 3rd party employee used the same password for access to all her social media accounts. The passwords for each accound should have been different to each other.
2. Multifactor authentication is required for all admins so that even if your password is compromised, you have 2nd layer of protection.
3. Do a review frequently enough to see who no longer needed access so that that particular employee, who resigned or moved to a different department, does not have any more access to the sysetm. Someone must be responsible and accountable to regularly review who has access. Make it into one's job description.
4. Have lists of people whom you can call and people to whom you can escalate.
5. Money talks. Spend directly with the social media platform and more money to get better response levels.
5. 3rd party companies, who are partner in the business, may not have strong security. So ask questions to get more info and asses.
- How do you handle any personally identifiable information?
- Technology
- Access management
- Assessment of 3rd party tools that connect to your platform.
- Escalation process when a account is taken over?
- SLA for responding to a hack.

People are uncomfortable to be responsible and accountable. Very few want to examine what he/she could have done better or differently to prevent an unfortunate event. Rather it's common in people to deflect.

At the end of the chapter, it seems like the author is puttig more responsibility in all the other employees. Putting the rifle on other's shoulder.
