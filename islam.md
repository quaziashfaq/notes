# Between Madrassa and Academia

## Strengths of madrasa:
1. Memorization - not just hadith, but also sanad
2. Meant to reinforce your faith, not just learning 
3. Students will usually have learned all branches of the Islamic sciences - at least to a competent level - it is a comprehensive education of Islam (whereas western academia might only study one area in depth) 
4. Better knowledge of Arabic (in western academia, sometimes there is a poor grasp of Arabic, even poor pronunciation) 

Differences in madrasa  :
1. Strictly sticks to brand of thought (even confessions in a different school of theology can result in dismissal of student)
2. Curriculum sticks to original sources written centuries ago, and dealing with controversies of a millenia ago, not relevant to the society living this day
3. Red Lines are strict also on questioning interpretations of great scholars
4. Stating a fact not mentioned by predecessors in original sense are unwelcome
5. Unhealthy level of hostility towards people outside traditional scholarship

## Strengths of academy  :
1. Learn life and context of scholar and consider the impact of his era in formation of his views
2. Learn other languages and cultures and the original scholarship in those languages (French and German in addition of Persian)
3. Learn how works were seen in successive centuries before you form your own opinion
4. Present what all authors in your generation have studied on the author and topic
5. Source works are not outside criticism, rather welcomes new ideas on the table

Differences in academy  : 
1. Subtle enforcement of idea of human authorship of Qur'an
2. Study is often limited to one particular area of scholarship that there are gaps of understanding unthinkable for a madrasa student (An Emeritus Professor misread a full word in Ayat ul Kursi and didn't realize his mistake - a junior school madrasa student would correct him if he heard it)
3. Dismissal of students from traditional scholarship despite merit in the research presented, and vice versa research on alphabetic ideas flavoured in Islam can get high level approvals even with absolute lack of academic merit
4. Hostility to Abrahamic values of morality and family is to the level of cancellation. Personal social media posts on positions of faith will result in academic boycotts if academic red lines are crossed (alphabet concerns)

## Conclusion  :
1. Third space needs to be created where madrasa students can train with critical tools of the academy
2. More Muslims should study in the Academy (whilst also recognising and being aware of the inherent biases, dangers, constraints and pressures from within the Academy system)
3. Madrassahs need to revamp and update their curricula
