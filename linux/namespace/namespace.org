There are currently 7 types of namespaces Cgroup, IPC, Network, Mount, PID, User, UTS.
At any given moment, any process P belongs to exactly one instance of each namespace type - so when it needs to say, update the route table on the system, Linux shows it the copy of the route table of the namespace to which it belongs at that moment.

* Cgroup

* IPC

* Network
Network namespace encapsulates system resources related to networking such as network interfaces (e.g wlan0, eth0), route tables etc,

* Mount
Mount namespace encapsulates files and directories in the system

* PID
 PID contains process IDs
