# Master Boot Record (MBR) and Boot Loader

Once the POST is completed, the system control passes from the BIOS to the boot loader. The boot loader is usually stored on one of the hard disks in the system, either in the boot sector (for traditional BIOS/MBR systems) or the EFI partition (for more recent (Unified) Extensible Firmware Interface or EFI/UEFI systems). Up to this stage, the machine does not access any mass storage media. Thereafter, information on date, time, and the most important peripherals are loaded from the CMOS values (after a technology used for the battery-powered memory store which allows the system to keep track of the date and time even when it is powered off).

A number of boot loaders exist for Linux; the most common ones are GRUB (for GRand Unified Boot loader), ISOLINUX (for booting from removable media), and DAS U-Boot (for booting on embedded devices/appliances). Most Linux boot loaders can present a user interface for choosing alternative options for booting Linux, and even other operating systems that might be installed. When booting Linux, the boot loader is responsible for loading the kernel image and the initial RAM disk or filesystem (which contains some critical files and device drivers needed to start the system) into memory.
