There are currently 7 types of namespaces Cgroup, IPC, Network, Mount, PID, User, UTS.

* Cgroup

* IPC

* Network
Network namespace encapsulates system resources related to networking such as network interfaces (e.g wlan0, eth0), route tables etc,
A network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices. By default a process inherits its network namespace from its parent. Initially all the processes share the same default network namespace from the init process.

* Mount
Mount namespace encapsulates files and directories in the system
* PID
 PID contains process IDs
