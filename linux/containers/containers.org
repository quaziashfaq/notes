#+TITLE: Containers


There are four basic primitives to learn to get you from Linux administrator to feeling comfortable with containers:

    Container Images
    Container Registries / Registry Server
    Container Hosts
    Container Orchestration

Once, you understand the basic four primitives, there are some advanced concepts that will be covered in future labs including:

    Container Standards: Understanding OCI, CRI, CNI, and more
    Container Tools Ecosystem - Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, cloud registries, etc
    Production Image Builds: Sharing and collaborating between technical specialists (performance, network, security, databases, etc)
    Intermediate Architecture: Production environments
    Advanced Architecture: Building in resilience
    Container History: Context for where we are at today


Container Engines:
All major container engines including Podman, Docker, RKT, CRI-O and containerd build and consume these bundles.
